		<h2>Sarah Calver Is With Fortnite</h2>
	<p>Fornite is a great game that can be played by anyone, adults, teenages or kids. It is a friendly cartoon looking game that is highly competitive. There are alot of different types of Battle Royal games in Fornite that you can play as well. It is a free game so you can play it anytime you want! They have season passes that you can pay for so you can complete challenges and unlock more characters and equipment. It has become a very popular game. </p>

		<h2>Felix Kang's Against Fortnite</h2>
			<p>Even the Fortnite is a very famous game all over the world, it is made for kids by looking the graphics. I prefer the game that more realistic like Rainbow Six Siege, the shooting game should be shooting not a cartoon shooting. No one should shoot thier weapon while jumping in the air, that looks weird. And that is not going to happen in real life.</p>
